This project is a high-fidelity radar system simulation written in C++, designed to model modern radar signal processing and tracking pipelines. The goal is to incrementally build a realistic, extensible framework that mirrors the conceptual architecture used in real-world radar systems.

The project prioritizes correct structure, physics-inspired modeling, and scalability over toy examples.

DISCLAIMER:

**This is a simulation and educational research project.
It is not intended to represent classified, proprietary, or operational radar systems.**

Build & Run
g++ -std=c++17 radar.cpp -o radar
./radar


(Exact build steps may change as the project matures.)
